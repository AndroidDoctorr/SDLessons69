         *  Create a Room class that has three properties:
                one each for the length, width, and height.
         *  Create a method that calculates total square footage.
         *  We also would like to include some constants that the
            define a minimum and maximum length, width, and height.
         *  When setting the properties, make sure to compare
            the values to the min/max and only set them if the
            value is valid.

        Bonus:
         *  Create a method that calculates total lateral surface area.
        Only allow the properties to be set from inside the class itself.
        Throw an exception if the given value is outside the permitted range.
        Test the code like we did with the Vehicle tests.
